# Education, Health, and Political Influence on Schooling Policies

## 📌 Project Overview
This project examines the **causal effect of education on health outcomes** using **compulsory schooling laws as an instrumental variable**. Additionally, it proposes a new research hypothesis on **how the political party of state governors influences the strictness of compulsory schooling laws**.

## 📊 Key Components
1. **Replication of Fletcher (2015)**  
   - Uses compulsory schooling laws as an instrument to estimate the effect of education on health.
   - Discusses potential sources of endogeneity, measurement error, and omitted variable bias.
   - Implements OLS and IV estimation.

2. **New Research Hypothesis**  
   - Investigates whether **state governors' political affiliations** (Democrat vs. Republican) predict the **strictness of compulsory schooling laws**.
   - Constructs a model using **governor’s party, state legislature composition, and demographic factors**.
   - Discusses **statistical challenges** such as multicollinearity and statistical power limitations.


## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Each additional year of education** is associated with improved health outcomes (lower mortality, better self-reported health).
- **Instrumental variables (IV) estimation** suggests a stronger causal effect than OLS.
- **Proposed research** suggests that **Republican governors may implement less strict compulsory schooling laws**, though statistical power limitations pose challenges.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include more recent education policies.
- Analyze political ideology's effect on education spending.
- Improve measurement of compulsory schooling laws.
